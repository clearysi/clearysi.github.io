  <p class="text">From 5th-8th June 2023, ELIXIR Ireland had the pleasure of welcoming ELIXIR members from all over Europe to the 9th ELIXIR All Hands Meeting (AHM) hosted at Dublin's Convention Centre. The event brought together approximately 400 in-person guests, with a further 114 remote guests joining online. The annual event offered members from each of the 23 nodes plus the ELIXIR hub the opportunity to discuss the successes of the previous year and plans for the future.</p>

 <p class="text">The keynote talk was given by Des Higgins, Professor Emeritus of Bioinformatics at University College Dublin, who reflected on the last 35 years of working on the revolutionary bioinformatics tool CLUSTAL for multiple sequence alignment. Des highlighted the challenges faced by early bioinformaticians and emphasized the benefits of using FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and Open Research principles in research. Des's presentation was a highlight of the week.</p>

   <p>ELIXIR Ireland node members were well-represented throughout the event. Prof. Gianpiero Cavalleri (RCSI) gave an update on "ELIXIR, Ireland, and Human Genomics" during the Human Genomics and Translational Data 2024-28 mini-symposium. Gianpiero highlighted the genomics challenges Ireland has been experiencing and the changes that are currently taking place.</p>

<p class="text">Prof. Aedin Culhane (UL) and Dr. Maria Doyle (UL) alongside Prof. Leo Lahti (ELIXIR-FI) led a successful workshop titled "Opportunities for Bioconductor and ELIXIR communities to co-develop training infrastructure" on 9th June. The workshop fostered an engaging discussion on connecting ELIXIR and Bioconductor to encourage collaboration in terms of training, data development, and infrastructure.</p>

  <p>The meeting provided plenty of opportunities to socialize and network, with the main social event of the week taking place at the <a href="https://epicchq.com"> EPIC </a> museum. Attendees had the chance to learn about the Irish diaspora and its global impact on science, politics, literature, and more. Entertainment included a traditional music session with Irish dancers showcasing Irish culture.</p>

  <p>We look forward to next year's ELIXIR All Hands Meeting in Uppsala, Sweden!</p>
