    <h1> Ireland hosts ELIXIR All Hands Meeting 2023 </h1>
      <p>From 5th-8th June 2023 ELIXIR Ireland had the pleasure of welcoming 
        ELIXIR members from all over Europe attending the 9th ELIXIR All Hands 
        Meeting (AHM) hosted at Dublin’s Convention Centre. The event brought 
        together ~400 in-person guests with a further 114 remote guests joining 
        online. The annual event offered members from each of the 23 nodes plus 
        the ELIXIR hub the opportunity to meet to discuss the successes of the 
        previous year as well as the chance to discuss plans for the future. </p>

      <p>The keynote talk was given by Des Higgins, Professor Emeritus of 
        Bioinformatics at University College Dublin, who gave an impressive 
        reflection on the last 35 years of working on the revolutionary 
        bioinformatics tool CLUSTAL for multiple sequence alignment. 
        His inspiring talk highlighted the challenges for early bioinformaticians 
        during an era when internet access was uncommon and sharing of software, 
        data, ideas and results were difficult. He credited ease of access, 
        usability and detailed documentation with CLUSTAL’s success highlighting 
        the benefits of using FAIR and Open Research principles in research. 
        Unsurprisingly, Des received a roaring applause from the audience and 
        his presentation was a highlight of the week.</p>
      <p>ELIXIR Ireland node members were well represented throughout the event. 
        On the first day, Gianpiero Cavalleri (RCSI) gave an update on “ELIXIR, 
        Ireland and Human Genomics” during the Human Genomics and Translational 
        Data 2024-28 mini-symposium. During this talk Gianpiero highlighted the 
        genomics challenges Ireland has been experiencing and the changes that 
        are currently taking place. These changes were recently announced in 
        the HSE National Genetics and Genomics Strategy for Ireland as well as 
        through Ireland’s participation in GDI co-lead by Gianpiero with ELIXIR 
        Ireland Head of Node, Denis Shields. This gives hope to a brighter future 
        for genomics healthcare in Ireland through continued coordination between 
        GDI Ireland and the emerging national strategy.</p>
      <p>Aedin Culhane (UL) and Maria Doyle (UL) alongside Leo Lahti (ELIXIR-FI) 
        led a successful workshop entitled  “Opportunities for Bioconductor and 
        ELIXIR communities to co-develop training infrastructure” on 9th June. 
        During this event they facilitated an engaging discussion on connecting 
        ELIXIR and Bioconductor to encourage joint opportunities in terms of training 
        and developing data, tools and compute infrastructures.</p>
      <p>The AHM provided plenty of opportunities to socialise and network with 
        the main social event of the week taking place at the EPIC museum. This 
        offered a chance for meeting attendees to learn about the Irish diaspora, 
        the reasons for the steady flow of emigrants from our island and the 
        global impact it had and continues to have on science,  politics, 
        literature and more all over the world. Entertainment was provided in 
        the form of a traditional music session with Irish dancers showcasing 
        Irish culture and it didn’t take much encouragement for all to join in 
        with ELIXIR Ireland members proudly stepping forward to lead everyone 
        in their own rendition of the ”Siege of Ennis” céilí dance. </p>
      <p>We look forward to next year’s ELIXXIR All Hands Meeting in Uppsala Sweden!</p>
