        <p>From 5th-8th June 2023, ELIXIR Ireland had the pleasure of welcoming ELIXIR members from all over Europe to the 9th ELIXIR All Hands Meeting (AHM) hosted at Dublin's Convention Centre. The event brought together approximately 400 in-person guests, with a further 114 remote guests joining online.

        <p>The keynote talk was given by Des Higgins, Professor Emeritus of Bioinformatics at University College Dublin, who reflected on the last 35 years of working on the revolutionary bioinformatics tool CLUSTAL for multiple sequence alignment. Des highlighted the challenges faced by early bioinformaticians and emphasized the benefits of using FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and Open Research principles in research. Des's presentation was a highlight of the week.</p>
